Below is an overview of the source code for the final project of the *Advanced Programming Languages for A.I.* course [H02A8A]. Every procedure is preceded by documentation.

Authors : MichaÃ«l Dooreman & Bruno Vandekerkhove

## Sudoku

ECLiPSe source code in /src/sudoku/eclipse/.
CHR source code in /src/sudoku/chr/.

All the ECLiPSe models are in /src/sudoku/eclipse/model/.
The channeling constraints are in combined.pl.
The model with nothing but channeling constraints is in channeling.pl.
The other filenames should be obvious.

All the CHR models are in /src/sudoku/chr/model/.
Note that not all of the models mentioned in the report were implemented in this language.

The benchmarks and automated benchmarking code is in /src/sudoku/benchmarks.

## Hashiwokakero



## Scheduling Meetings

All the code lies in /src/scheduiing/scheduling.pl.
The first procedure is the entry point.
The next procedures generate constraints (including implied constraints).
The last procedure automates benchmarking.
