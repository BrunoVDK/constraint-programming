## Constraint Handling Rules

Commited choice language ; unlike Prolog, once you make a choice, you're stuck with it.
Created by Thom Frühwirth.

**CHR rules**

 - Simplification (removes constraints, adds new ones to constraint store)
 - Propagation (similar to simplification, doesn't remove constraints)
 - Simpagation (combines simplification and propagation)
