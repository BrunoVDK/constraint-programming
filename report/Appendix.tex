Some questions were asked online after all the code had been written. There were four of them. One on how to enforce equality of lists. One on looping through a list which is a subscript of an array. One on the inner workings of \texttt{ic\_global:occurrences/3}. And a final one on memory usage. Aside from a quick experiment with \texttt{$\sim$=/2} no code was rewritten as a result. All the viewpoints were either thought of by ourselves or come from the literature that was cited in this report.
